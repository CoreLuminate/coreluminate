You've decided to build or redesign your website—great! But before you jump in, taking time to prepare can make the difference between a smooth project and a frustrating one.

After helping dozens of small businesses launch their websites, I've seen firsthand what makes projects successful. Here's exactly what you need to prepare before starting your website project.

## 1. Define Your Goals (The "Why")

Before thinking about design or features, get crystal clear on **why** you need a website.

### Ask yourself:

- **What's the primary purpose?** Generate leads? Sell products? Build credibility? Provide information?
- **What action do you want visitors to take?** Contact you? Make a purchase? Schedule a consultation?
- **How will you measure success?** More inquiries? Online sales? Reduced support calls?

**Example:** A local plumber might say: "I want a website that generates 10 quality service calls per month from homeowners in my area who need emergency or scheduled plumbing work."

That's specific, measurable, and actionable.

## 2. Know Your Audience

You're not building this website for yourself—you're building it for your customers.

### Questions to answer:

- Who are your ideal customers? (Age, location, income, pain points)
- What problems are they trying to solve?
- What questions do they have before buying?
- What objections might they have?
- How do they currently find businesses like yours?

**Pro tip:** If you already have customers, talk to them! Ask what made them choose you and what they wished they knew before hiring you.

## 3. Gather Your Content

Content is usually the biggest bottleneck in website projects. Start collecting this stuff now:

### Text Content:

- **About your business:** Your story, mission, what makes you different
- **Service/product descriptions:** What you offer and who it's for
- **Testimonials:** Customer reviews, success stories, case studies
- **Team bios:** Who you are, your experience, why clients should trust you
- **FAQs:** Common questions you get from customers

### Visual Content:

- **Logo files:** Vector format (AI, EPS, SVG) if possible
- **Photos:** Team photos, workspace, products, previous work
- **Brand colors:** Hex codes or RGB values
- **Existing marketing materials:** Brochures, business cards, etc.

**Don't have professional photos?** That's okay. Modern smartphones take great photos. Just make sure they're well-lit and high resolution.

## 4. Study Your Competition

Visit 5-10 competitor websites and take notes:

- What do you like? (Design, features, messaging)
- What don't you like? (Confusing navigation, slow loading)
- What are they doing that works?
- What are they missing that you could do better?

**Important:** This isn't about copying—it's about understanding what works in your industry and finding opportunities to stand out.

## 5. Compile Your "Inspiration List"

Find 3-5 websites you love (they don't have to be in your industry).

For each one, note:

- **What you like:** Layout? Colors? How it feels?
- **Specific elements:** Navigation style? Button design? Image use?
- **Why it works:** Does it feel trustworthy? Modern? Easy to use?

Save screenshots or URLs and share them with your designer. It helps us understand your taste and vision.

## 6. List Your Must-Have Features

What does your website **need** to do? Common features include:

**Basic:**

- Contact form
- Google Maps integration
- Click-to-call phone number
- Mobile-responsive design
- SSL certificate (security)

**Intermediate:**

- Online booking/scheduling
- Email newsletter signup
- Photo galleries
- Blog
- Customer portal/login

**Advanced:**

- E-commerce (sell products)
- Custom quote calculator
- CRM integration
- Payment processing
- Member-only areas

**Be honest about what you actually need** versus nice-to-have. You can always add features later.

## 7. Determine Your Budget

Website costs vary wildly. Here's a realistic breakdown for small businesses:

- **DIY (Wix, Squarespace):** $200-500/year (your time + subscriptions)
- **Template-based:** $500-2,000 (designer customizes a template)
- **Semi-custom:** $2,000-5,000 (custom design, some template elements)
- **Fully custom:** $5,000-15,000+ (everything built from scratch)

**Pro tip:** Budget for ongoing costs too:

- Domain: $15-50/year
- Hosting: $100-500/year
- SSL certificate: $0-100/year (often free)
- Maintenance: $50-200/month (or DIY)

## 8. Understand Your Timeline

Realistic website timelines:

- **Simple template site:** 1-2 weeks
- **Custom small business site (5-10 pages):** 4-6 weeks
- **E-commerce or complex features:** 8-12+ weeks

**Remember:** Your involvement affects timeline. The faster you provide content, feedback, and approvals, the faster your site launches.

## 9. Think About Post-Launch

Your website isn't "done" when it launches. Plan for:

- **Who updates content?** You or your developer?
- **How will you drive traffic?** SEO? Ads? Social media?
- **How will you track results?** Google Analytics? Other tools?
- **What's your maintenance plan?** Updates, backups, security?

## 10. Choose the Right Partner

Finally, find someone who:

- **Understands small businesses** (not just big corporate clients)
- **Communicates clearly** (no jargon, responds promptly)
- **Provides transparent pricing** (no hidden fees)
- **Offers training** (so you can make simple updates yourself)
- **Thinks long-term** (not just "get it done and disappear")
